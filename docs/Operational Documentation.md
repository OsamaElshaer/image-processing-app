# **Operational Documentation**

**Project Title:** Image Processing Application
**Prepared By:** Osama Elshaer
**Date:** 12/14/2024

------

## **1. Introduction**

The purpose of this operational documentation is to define the processes and strategies for deploying, managing, monitoring, and maintaining the Image Processing Application. It covers deployment pipelines, system monitoring, logging strategies, backup and recovery plans, and incident management procedures to ensure the system’s performance, availability, and security.

------

## **2. Deployment Strategy**

### **2.1 Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

The system will leverage a robust CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, integration, and deployment of updates. This ensures that new features and bug fixes are quickly integrated into the application without sacrificing stability.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
  The CI pipeline will automatically run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests on every pull request to ensure code quality. It will be powered by tools such as **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, or **GitLab CI**.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**:
  After the code passes the CI tests, the changes will be automatically deployed to a staging environment. Upon successful validation in staging, the application will be deployed to production with minimal downtime.

### **2.2 Infrastructure**

The application will be deployed on **AWS** (Amazon Web Services), utilizing the following services:

- **Compute**: The application will be containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated using **Kubernetes** to provide a scalable and resilient architecture.
- **Storage**:
  - **AWS S3** will be used for storing images.
  - **PostgreSQL** will be deployed on **AWS RDS** for metadata storage.
- **Message Queue**:
  - **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka** will be deployed for handling asynchronous tasks related to image processing.
- **Load Balancer**:
  **AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** will distribute traffic to application instances and ensure high availability.

### **2.3 Version Control**

- **Git** will be used for version control with **GitHub** or **GitLab** repositories.
- The branching strategy will follow **GitFlow**, ensuring that features, fixes, and releases are managed in separate branches.

------

## **3. Monitoring and Health Checks**

### **3.1 Monitoring Strategy**

To ensure optimal performance and uptime, the application will be actively monitored using the following tools:

- Prometheus

   and 

  Grafana

   will monitor and visualize key application metrics such as:

  - CPU and memory utilization
  - Request/response time
  - Error rates

- **Datadog** or **New Relic** will be used for full-stack observability, providing insights into the health of the entire system from the application level to infrastructure.

### **3.2 Health Check Endpoints**

- Every microservice will expose a health check endpoint, such as `/health`, that will be polled at regular intervals to monitor the service’s operational status.
- **Kubernetes** will use these health check endpoints to automatically restart failed services.

------

## **4. Logging Strategy**

### **4.1 Centralized Logging**

- Logs from all services will be collected and aggregated in a central logging system using the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **AWS CloudWatch**.
- The logs will be structured in JSON format, making them easy to search and filter.

### **4.2 Types of Logs**

- **Application Logs**:
  These logs will capture requests to and from the microservices, error logs, and debug information.
- **Access Logs**:
  Every API request will be logged to capture usage patterns, request/response times, and any potential security threats.
- **Error Logs**:
  Any unhandled exceptions or errors will be logged with details such as the stack trace and context to facilitate debugging.

### **4.3 Log Retention and Archiving**

- Logs will be retained for a configurable period (e.g., 30 days) in Elasticsearch or CloudWatch.
- Older logs will be archived in cold storage or deleted, based on the company’s data retention policy.

### **4.4 Log Aggregation and Analysis**

- **Kibana** or **CloudWatch Dashboards** will be used for real-time log aggregation and analysis. Alerts will be set up for critical errors, such as 5xx server errors, unauthorized access attempts, and failed login attempts.

------

## **5. Backup and Disaster Recovery**

### **5.1 Backup Strategy**

- **Database Backups**:
  Daily **incremental backups** will be taken for PostgreSQL, with full backups every week. These backups will be stored in geographically distributed locations within AWS to ensure data safety.
- **Image Data Backups**:
  Images stored in **S3** will be backed up periodically using the provider’s backup functionality or through custom backup scripts.

### **5.2 Disaster Recovery Plan**

In case of an application or database failure:

1. **Restore from Backup**:
   The database and image files will be restored from the most recent backup, ensuring minimal data loss.
2. **Failover Mechanism**:
   The system will use **AWS RDS Multi-AZ deployments** to automatically failover to a secondary instance if the primary database instance becomes unavailable.
3. **Re-deploying Services**:
   Application services will be re-deployed using Kubernetes, which ensures high availability and can recover from failures by restarting failed containers automatically.

------

## **6. Security Considerations**

### **6.1 Authentication and Authorization**

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** will be used for authenticating API requests across microservices.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented to restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles.

### **6.2 Data Encryption**

- **In-Transit**:
  All communications between microservices and between clients and the API Gateway will be encrypted using **TLS/SSL**.
- **At-Rest**:
  Sensitive data (e.g., user credentials) will be stored encrypted using industry-standard algorithms such as **AES-256**.

### **6.3 Security Audits**

- Regular security audits will be conducted to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- All access and error logs will be reviewed periodically for unauthorized access or suspicious activities.

------

## **7. Resource Scaling and Cost Management**

### **7.1 Horizontal Scaling**

- **Kubernetes** will be used for container orchestration, ensuring that services can scale horizontally in response to increased traffic or load. Each microservice will be replicated across multiple containers to ensure high availability.
- **Auto-Scaling**:
  Based on resource utilization (CPU, memory), **AWS Auto Scaling** or Kubernetes’ Horizontal Pod Autoscaler will automatically scale the application.

### **7.2 Cost Management**

- Cost monitoring will be set up using **AWS Cost Explorer** or **CloudWatch Billing Alerts** to track and manage infrastructure costs.
- Unused or underutilized resources will be decommissioned or scaled down to reduce costs.

------

## **8. Incident Management and Support**

### **8.1 Incident Response Plan**

- In case of a system failure or performance degradation, the **on-call engineering team** will be alerted automatically through **Slack**, **PagerDuty**, or similar notification systems.
- The **incident commander** will follow a predefined escalation process to diagnose and resolve the issue, involving the appropriate team members.

### **8.2 Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**

- After every critical incident, a **Root Cause Analysis** will be performed to identify the underlying issue and prevent recurrence.
- The findings will be documented and shared with the development team to apply corrective measures.

### **8.3 Support and Maintenance**

- A **dedicated support team** will handle user queries, resolve issues, and provide assistance. The support team will be available 24/7 for critical issues.
- Regular **maintenance windows** will be scheduled for updates, security patches, and performance optimization.
