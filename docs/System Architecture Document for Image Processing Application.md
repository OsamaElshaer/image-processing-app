### **System Architecture Document for Image Processing Application**

------

## 1. **Introduction**

### 1.1 **Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to define the system architecture for the Image Processing Application based on a microservices architecture. This document will cover the design of individual microservices, their interactions, and the overall deployment strategy to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability.

### 1.2 **Scope**

The system architecture will include:

- Definition of individual microservices.
- Communication patterns between services.
- Message flows and integration.
- Deployment strategies for scalability and resilience.

------

## 2. **System Overview**

The Image Processing Application will use microservices to process images asynchronously. Users will upload images, request various processing tasks, and receive notifications once the tasks are completed. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and fault-tolerant, with clear separation of concerns between services.

## 3. **Microservices Overview**

### 3.1 **List of Microservices**

The application will be divided into the following core microservices:

1. API Gateway Service
   - **Responsibilities**: Routes client requests to the appropriate microservice. Handles authentication and authorization.
   - **Technologies**: Node.js, Express.js.
2. User Service
   - **Responsibilities**: Manages user registration, authentication, and profile management.
   - **Technologies**: Node.js, MongoDB (for user metadata), JWT for session management.
3. Image Upload Service
   - **Responsibilities**: Accepts image uploads, validates the file format, stores the image in a storage service (e.g., AWS S3), and generates metadata.
   - **Technologies**: Node.js, AWS SDK for S3, MongoDB (for image metadata).
4. Image Processing Service
   - **Responsibilities**: Retrieves images and metadata from storage, performs image processing tasks (resize, filter, watermark, convert format), and stores processed images back.
   - **Technologies**: Node.js, Image processing libraries (e.g., Sharp), AWS SDK for S3.
5. Notification Service
   - **Responsibilities**: Sends notifications (email, SMS, push notifications) to users when their image processing task is completed.
   - **Technologies**: Node.js, external notification providers (e.g., SendGrid for email, Firebase for push notifications).
6. Logging Service
   - **Responsibilities**: Collects logs from all services and forwards them to a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack) for monitoring and debugging.
   - **Technologies**: Node.js, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
7. Queue Service (RabbitMQ)
   - **Responsibilities**: Manages message queues for asynchronous processing of tasks (e.g., queuing image processing jobs).
   - **Technologies**: RabbitMQ.

## 4. **Service Interactions and Message Flow**

### 4.1 **API Gateway to Microservices**

The **API Gateway** is the entry point for client requests. It will authenticate incoming requests, validate input, and route them to the appropriate microservice:

- **Image Upload**: The API Gateway routes image upload requests to the **Image Upload Service**.
- **User Authentication**: Routes user login and registration requests to the **User Service**.
- **Image Processing Request**: When an image upload is successful, the **Image Upload Service** will send a message to the **Queue Service** for processing.

### 4.2 **Message Flow**

- Step 1: User uploads an image via the 

  API Gateway.

  - The **API Gateway** routes the image upload request to the **Image Upload Service**.
  - **Image Upload Service** stores the image in AWS S3, generates metadata, and stores it in MongoDB.
  - The **Image Upload Service** then sends a message to the **Queue Service** (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for image processing.

- Step 2: The Queue Service places the task in a queue and triggers the Image Processing Service.

  - The **Image Processing Service** retrieves the image from AWS S3 using the metadata, processes it, and stores the processed image back in S3.

- Step 3: After processing, the Image Processing Service sends a message to the Notification Service.

  - The **Notification Service** sends notifications (email, push) to the user with a download link to the processed image.

### 4.3 **Data Flow**

- **User Service** stores user credentials and profile information in MongoDB.
- **Image Upload Service** stores image metadata in MongoDB and image files in AWS S3.
- **Image Processing Service** uses AWS S3 for storing images and MongoDB for metadata storage.
- **Notification Service** sends notifications and may query user preferences from the **User Service**.

------

## 5. **Deployment Strategy**

### 5.1 **Containerization**

Each microservice will be deployed in a **Docker container** to ensure isolation, consistency, and portability. Containers allow for easy scaling, testing, and deployment across different environments.

### 5.2 **Orchestration with Kubernetes**

Kubernetes will be used for orchestrating and managing the deployment of microservices. It will handle:

- **Automatic Scaling**: Kubernetes will scale the microservices based on demand (e.g., image processing load).
- **Service Discovery**: Microservices will register with Kubernetes for automatic service discovery.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Kubernetes ensures that failed instances of services are replaced automatically.

### 5.3 **Cloud Infrastructure**

- **AWS EC2** for hosting the Kubernetes cluster and microservices.
- **AWS S3** for image storage.
- **AWS RDS (or MongoDB Atlas)** for managed database services.
- **RabbitMQ** hosted on AWS (or use AWS managed service for MQ).

### 5.4 **CI/CD Pipeline**

- **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI** will be used for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
- Automated tests will be run for each service before deployment, and code will be automatically pushed to production upon successful tests.

------

## 6. **Security Considerations**

- **Authentication and Authorization**: JWT (JSON Web Token) will be used to secure user sessions and ensure proper access control between services.
- **Data Encryption**: HTTPS (TLS) will be enforced for all communication between services, and sensitive data (e.g., user passwords) will be stored securely with encryption.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: The **Logging Service** will aggregate logs for monitoring system behavior and identifying potential security issues.

------

## 7. **Scalability and Fault Tolerance**

- **Horizontal Scaling**: All microservices will be designed to scale horizontally, with Kubernetes managing the scaling process.
- **Resilience**: Each service is independent, so failure in one service (e.g., image processing) will not affect others (e.g., user service, notification service).
- **Load Balancing**: The **API Gateway** will distribute incoming requests evenly across available instances of each service.
