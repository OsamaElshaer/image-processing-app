1. ## **System Design Document for Image Processing Application**

    ### 1. **Introduction**

    This document outlines the **System Design** for the **Image Processing Application**. The system is built using a **microservices architecture** to handle image uploads, transformations, and notifications. It is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and highly available. The application supports asynchronous processing of image tasks such as resizing, applying filters, watermarking, and format conversion.

    ### 2. **System Architecture Overview**

    The system is designed as a **cloud-native microservices application**, leveraging containerization and orchestration for scalability and fault tolerance. Each microservice is deployed as an independent container, and communication between services is done asynchronously using a **message queue** (RabbitMQ/Kafka).

    The major components of the system architecture are:

    - **API Gateway**: Handles all incoming user requests and routes them to appropriate services.
    - **Image Upload Service**: Accepts image files, validates them, and uploads them to **AWS S3**.
    - **Image Processing Service**: Performs image transformations (resize, filter, watermark) and saves the processed images.
    - **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users once the image processing is completed.
    - **User Service**: Manages user authentication and profile data.
    - **Logging Service**: Collects logs from all services for centralized monitoring.
    - **Message Queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka)**: Ensures that image processing is done asynchronously and decouples services.
    - **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores user metadata and task details.

    The application is designed to scale horizontally. Microservices are isolated, so each service can scale independently based on demand.

    ### 3. **Microservices Components**

    The following microservices make up the application:

    #### 3.1 **API Gateway**

    - Responsibilities:
      - Routes incoming requests to appropriate backend services.
      - Handles authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
      - Provides an abstraction layer for all internal microservices, ensuring that users donâ€™t need to interact directly with each service.
    - Key Functions:
      - Validate incoming requests.
      - Forward requests to **Image Upload Service**, **Image Processing Service**, or **Notification Service**.
      - Ensure that API responses conform to the correct formats.

    #### 3.2 **Image Upload Service**

    - Responsibilities:
      - Accepts image files from users via an API call.
      - Validates file type, size, and other constraints.
      - Stores the image in **AWS S3** (or a local server) for persistent storage.
      - Sends an image processing task to the **message queue** to initiate the asynchronous processing.
    - Key Functions:
      - Handle file uploads.
      - Perform basic validation on uploaded files (file size, file type).
      - Generate metadata for the image and send processing requests to the queue.

    #### 3.3 **Image Processing Service**

    - Responsibilities:
      - Retrieves image data from the storage (AWS S3 or local storage).
      - Performs image transformations such as resizing, applying filters (grayscale, blur, sharpen), adding watermarks, and converting between formats.
      - Stores the processed image back into the storage.
      - Sends a task completion notification to the **Notification Service**.
    - Key Functions:
      - Retrieve image from storage.
      - Process image based on user-defined transformations.
      - Store processed image back in storage.
      - Notify the **Notification Service** upon completion.

    #### 3.4 **Notification Service**

    - Responsibilities:
      - Notifies users once their image processing task is completed.
      - Sends notifications through email, push notifications, or webhooks.
      - Provides the user with a **download URL** for accessing the processed image.
    - Key Functions:
      - Communicate with the **Image Processing Service** to receive task completion signals.
      - Send notifications to users with a link to the processed image.

    #### 3.5 **User Service**

    - Responsibilities:
      - Manages user authentication (sign up, login) and profile management.
      - Implements **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to manage user permissions.
      - Stores user data in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
    - Key Functions:
      - Handle user registration and authentication.
      - Generate **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for session management.
      - Allow users to manage their profiles and track their image processing tasks.

    #### 3.6 **Logging Service**

    - Responsibilities:
      - Collects logs from all services for **centralized logging**.
      - Forwards logs to a **centralized logging system** (e.g., **ELK Stack**).
      - Ensures logs are structured and can be easily queried for troubleshooting.
    - Key Functions:
      - Capture logs from each service (Image Upload, Processing, Notification, etc.).
      - Store and forward logs to a centralized system (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
      - Provide real-time log querying and alerting.

    ### 4. **Service Interaction and Communication**

    Each microservice communicates with others using an **asynchronous message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka)**. This ensures that services are decoupled, and tasks like image processing can be handled independently.

    #### 4.1 **Communication Flow**:

    1. **Image Upload**:
       - A user uploads an image via the **API Gateway**.
       - The **API Gateway** forwards the request to the **Image Upload Service**.
       - The **Image Upload Service** validates the image and uploads it to **AWS S3**.
       - A task is sent to **RabbitMQ** to trigger the image processing task.
    2. **Image Processing**:
       - The **Image Processing Service** listens to the message queue and retrieves the image for processing.
       - Once processing is done, the **Image Processing Service** saves the processed image back to **AWS S3**.
       - A task completion message is sent to the **Notification Service**.
    3. **Notification**:
       - The **Notification Service** receives the task completion notification and informs the user via email or push notification.

    ### 5. **Deployment Strategy**

    The deployment of this system will follow a **cloud-native approach** using **Docker** for containerization and **Kubernetes** for orchestration. The services will be deployed across a cloud infrastructure, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.

    - **Containerization**: Each microservice will be packaged as a Docker container, which provides isolation and makes it easy to deploy and scale each service independently.
    - **Orchestration**: **Kubernetes** will be used to manage the deployment, scaling, and operation of the containers. Kubernetes handles tasks such as scaling the **Image Processing Service** based on demand, load balancing traffic, and rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments.
    - **Cloud**: The services will be deployed on **AWS** (or another cloud platform). Specific cloud components include:
      - **AWS EC2** for computing resources.
      - **AWS S3** for object storage.
      - **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)** for database hosting.
      - **AWS SNS/SQS** for messaging.
    - **CI/CD Pipeline**: A continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline will be set up using **GitHub Actions**, **Jenkins**, or **CircleCI** to automate builds, tests, and deployments.

    ### 6. **Scalability and Fault Tolerance**

    To ensure the system is **scalable** and **fault-tolerant**, we will implement several strategies:

    - **Horizontal Scaling**: Microservices will scale horizontally by adding more containers (instances) as the demand increases. This is managed by **Kubernetes**.
    - **Load Balancing**: **AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** will distribute incoming traffic to multiple instances of the **API Gateway** and other services to balance the load.
    - **Message Queue**: **RabbitMQ** will buffer image processing tasks, allowing for asynchronous processing. If the **Image Processing Service** is overloaded, tasks will be queued, and services will process them as resources become available.
    - **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes' **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** will automatically scale services like the **Image Processing Service** when the number of tasks in the queue increases.

    ### 7. **Data Flow and Message Flow**

    #### 7.1 **Image Upload and Processing Flow**

    1. **User uploads image** via the **API Gateway**.
    2. **API Gateway** forwards the request to the **Image Upload Service**.
       - The **Image Upload Service** validates the image (format, size) and stores it in **AWS S3**.
       - Metadata is generated for the image, including its storage location and processing task details.
    3. The **Image Upload Service** sends a message to the **message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka)**, indicating that image processing should begin.
    4. **Image Processing Service** retrieves the message from the queue, fetches the image from **AWS S3**, and performs the

5. After processing, the **Image Processing Service** stores the modified image back into **AWS S3** and sends a **task completion notification** to the **Notification Service** via the message queue.

6. **Notification Service** notifies the user (via email, webhook, or push notification) that their image has been processed and is ready for download.

#### 7.2 **Message Queue Interaction**

- **RabbitMQ/Kafka** is the core component enabling asynchronous communication between services.
- **Image Upload Service** sends a message (e.g., `ImageProcessingTask`) to the queue with metadata about the image (file location, task details).
- **Image Processing Service** listens for new messages and begins processing images upon receiving them.
- **Notification Service** listens for completed task notifications and informs the user about the status of their request.
- This messaging pattern ensures decoupling of services and allows for efficient scaling without directly impacting other components.

### 11. **Monitoring and Logging**

#### 11.1 **Logging**

- The system will use the **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.
- Logs from each service will be forwarded to **Logstash**, which will parse and index the logs into **Elasticsearch**.
- Logs will be accessible via **Kibana** dashboards for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

#### 11.2 **Monitoring**

- **Prometheus** will be used to monitor service performance (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, request/response times).
- **Grafana** dashboards will visualize service metrics, alerting for thresholds like high latency or service failures.
- **Alerting**: Critical alerts will be sent via **Slack** or **email** to the development team for quick resolution.
